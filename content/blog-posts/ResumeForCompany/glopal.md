## Bug Report

i reviewed russian shops provided by glopal.ru. You made a great work with translation but it's not accurate. In case of russian languge you are close to aliexpress level :(

worst eye leaking translation

[https://ru.jbtools.com/](https://ru.jbtools.com/ "https://ru.jbtools.com/") - Global shipping and 60-days Return - a red, big captions with incorrect endings 

Глобальн**ый** перевозк**и**: correct version Глобальные перевозки  but  is better to use here "International shipping" = Международная доставка, 

60-дневн**ый** Возвращен**ие** -> 60-дневный Возврат )

It seams you use automatic translation, but human translators/checkes should be used here - to ensure that translation is correct and readable.

Fonts

you don't modifiy fonts [https://ru-olpro.glopalstore.com/delivery/?utm_campaign=oth_r&utm_source=https://olproshop.com&utm_medium=wi_proxy&utm_content=en_GB&utm_term=a](https://ru-olpro.glopalstore.com/delivery/?utm_campaign=oth_r&utm_source=https://olproshop.com&utm_medium=wi_proxy&utm_content=en_GB&utm_term=a "https://ru-olpro.glopalstore.com/delivery/?utm_campaign=oth_r&utm_source=https://olproshop.com&utm_medium=wi_proxy&utm_content=en_GB&utm_term=a")

Maybe it just cyrilic/Russian problem but original site use "renner_book" or "Bebas Neue"font. Is must be Helvetica / Arial family without cyrillic letters so browser replace them with default serif font, so whole page become written in mixed serif / non serifs fonts and looks ugly.

Delivery pages:

as for me delivery page one of the most important pages, where i could know if delivery is worldwide, almoust all delivery pages i've check has information about UK, witch is non relevant for me. 

* [https://ru-chainspeed.glopalstore.com/delivery/](https://ru-chainspeed.glopalstore.com/delivery/ "https://ru-chainspeed.glopalstore.com/delivery/")  
* [https://ru.watcho.co.uk/info/delivery.html](https://ru.watcho.co.uk/info/delivery.html "https://ru.watcho.co.uk/info/delivery.html") 
* [https://ru.jbtools.com/shipping-returns/#international](https://ru.jbtools.com/shipping-returns/#international "https://ru.jbtools.com/shipping-returns/#international") - actually not delivered to RU

so may be glopal should rewrite delivery pages, at least remove infomation witch is not connected with user region.
