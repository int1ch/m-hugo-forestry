## Profile

Most of the experience I've got in Yandex, making the backend for best high loaded :) user-customized portal page. I do not fully match your requirements: I didn't dig DNS protocol yes. But I know regexp (heavy Perl background). Had crawler/extractor project based on CSS selector search. Wrote Frontend mostly for admin interfaces. Believe in Typescript - it makes code more predictable.

## Bug Report

I reviewed Russian shops provided by glopal.ru. You made great work with translation but it's not accurate. In the case of Russian language you are close to aliexpress level :(

worst eye leaking translation

[https://ru.jbtools.com/](https://ru.jbtools.com/ "https://ru.jbtools.com/") - Global shipping and 60-days Return - a red, big captions with incorrect endings

Глобальн**ый** перевозк**и**: correct version Глобальные перевозки  but  is better to use here "International shipping" = Международная доставка,

60-дневн**ый** Возвращен**ие** -> 60-дневный Возврат )

It seems you use an automatic translation, but human translators/checkes should be used here - to ensure that translation is correct and readable.

Fonts

you don't modify fonts [https://ru-olpro.glopalstore.com/delivery/?utm_campaign=oth_r&utm_source=https://olproshop.com&utm_medium=wi_proxy&utm_content=en_GB&utm_term=a](https://ru-olpro.glopalstore.com/delivery/?utm_campaign=oth_r&utm_source=https://olproshop.com&utm_medium=wi_proxy&utm_content=en_GB&utm_term=a "https://ru-olpro.glopalstore.com/delivery/?utm_campaign=oth_r&utm_source=https://olproshop.com&utm_medium=wi_proxy&utm_content=en_GB&utm_term=a")

Maybe it is just Cyrillic/Russian problem but the original site use "renner_book" or "Bebas Neue" font. It must be Helvetica / Arial family without Cyrillic letters, so the browser replaces them with a default serif font, so the whole page becomes written in mixed serif / non-serifs fonts and looks ugly.

Delivery pages:

As for me, the delivery page is one of the most important pages, where I could know if delivery is worldwide, almost all delivery pages I've checked have information about UK, which is nonrelevant for me.

* [https://ru-chainspeed.glopalstore.com/delivery/](https://ru-chainspeed.glopalstore.com/delivery/ "https://ru-chainspeed.glopalstore.com/delivery/")
* [https://ru.watcho.co.uk/info/delivery.html](https://ru.watcho.co.uk/info/delivery.html "https://ru.watcho.co.uk/info/delivery.html")
* [https://ru.jbtools.com/shipping-returns/#international](https://ru.jbtools.com/shipping-returns/#international "https://ru.jbtools.com/shipping-returns/#international") - actually not delivered to RU

so maybe Glopal should rewrite delivery pages, at least remove information witch is not connected with user region.
